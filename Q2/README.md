# Lapyear
## There is an easy algorithm to determine whether a year is a leap year or not as follows:

- If the number for the year is divisible by 400, then that year is definitely a leap year.
- If the number of years is not divisible by 400 but is evenly divided by 100, then that year is definitely not a leap year.
- If the number of years is not divisible by 400, not divisible by 100, but divisible by 4, then that year is a leap year.
- If the number of years is not divided by 400, is not divided by 100, and is not divided by 4, then the year is not a leap year.
